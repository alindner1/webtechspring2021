    <p>Hi there! My name is Andrea Lindner, and I'm a junior at Babson double concentrating in Information Technology Management and Operations Management. I am originally from Long Island, New York, but I moved to Connecticut a few years ago (I still have the accent though!). I have one 27-year-old sister who is the love of my life and my best friend. I also have a maltipoo 2-year-old puppy at home. On campus, I am a CWEL scholar, the President of Student Government, the Panhellenic Delegate of Chi Omega, and an Office Assistant at the Office of Student Engagement. </p>
	<p>I am really passionate about Student Government, and being SGA President has been one of my favorite pastimes over the year. Most of my free time has been spent leading my Executive Board, meeting with campus partners, and helping my members execute projects/events. As for more tangible hobbies, I love to craft and make yummy desserts. I love doing Pinterest DIY projects, tie-dying, painting, knitting, and doing anything crafty! I hope to teach myself how to embroider some time in the near future to expand this hobby. I also love to bake interesting desserts like zucchini brownies (they are delicious!), homemade oreos, and chocolate ice cream! I am also really passionate about technology. I taught myself how to code my freshman year of high school starting with some Python, and have continued this interest through coursework in my high school, at Olin/Babson, and through Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program as well as through online courses! I am really excited to continue learning in Web Technologies!</p>
