        FAVORITE SPOTS

    <h2>
        Winslow Park - Westport, CT
    </h2>
	<p>
        When I am extra good, I get to go to Winslow Park!
        <br>
        <br>
        This is my favorite Wednesday activity! I enjoy peeing on every single tree here and sniffing as many puppy butts as I can.       
        <br>
        <br>
        I am what I guess you can call a regular at this park. I love it here! I even know some of the other regulars at this park.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, I even see other maltipoos that look just like me here! How spooky!
        <br>
        <br>
        They also have an annual puppy festival during the summertime and WOW is that incredible. What an experience! They give out so many free samples and there are so many yippy dogs like me to chit chat with! They also even have a fun chasing race game which I love to watch! My favorite part is barking so piercingly loud as I cheer other dogs on! 
        <br>
        <br>
        11/10 would bring all my friends with me on a date here (perhaps even a nice young puppy suitor) here and would go back next week.
